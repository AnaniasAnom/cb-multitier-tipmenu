Screenshot shows a setup with three menus.

Initial menu is

* m1t1 - 5 tokens
* m1t2 - 10 tokens

When the goal of 100 is reached, the second menu replaces the first

* m2t1 - 5 tokens
* m2t2 - 25 tokens
* m2t3 - 35 tokens

When the goal of 500 is reached, the third menu comes in

* m3t1 - 5 tokens
* m3t2 - 50 tokens

You can have any number of menus and any varying number of items per menu, as
long as it fits in the 20 lines.
